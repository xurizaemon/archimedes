Archimedes Client (Drupal module)
=================================

This is a Drupal module client for the Archimedes Server, a passive applicationmonitoring system for web applications.

You'll need the [Archimedes PHP library](https://github.com/fiasco/Archimedes-Library) to use this module. 

If installing this module via Drush, the library should be automatically downloaded and installed.

Or, visit https://github.com/fiasco/Archimedes-Library, click on the Downloads button & select a compression format to download. Unpack the file and copy the archimedes.class.php file from the php directory into the root directory of the archimedes module.

Alternately you can just do:

    wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/fiasco/Archimedes-Library/raw/master/php/archimedes.class.php

Which will download the PHP archimedes class right from the master branch.
